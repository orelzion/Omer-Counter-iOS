# Omer-Counter-iOS
An iOS app and widget for counting the Omer

This is my first approach to learning and developing for iOS.

## Goals
My goal with this app is to 
* Create a widget that will auto populate every day at sunset
* Create an app for all 4 Nusachim which determines the user location to determine the sunset time, in order to display the full counter for him in the Nusach he choose
 
## Technologies
This app is written completly in Swift and is uses SwiftUi to building views
